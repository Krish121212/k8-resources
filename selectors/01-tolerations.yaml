# image pull policy two types: 1. IfNotPresent 2.Always
# Always pull a image even if it's changes or not - best option as IfNotPresent only pulls image it it's not present

# value is mandatory if you are using operator equal,we also have operator exist,not in,in,not exist etc..,

#NodeSelector won't work for taints, as it works on labels
